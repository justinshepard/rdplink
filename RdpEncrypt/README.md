RDP Encrypt Utilities
=====================

I stitched this utility together using a [VB.NET DPAPI sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20110724103709/http://www.obviex.com/samples/dpapi.aspx), [Remko Weijnen's RDP encryption research](http://www.remkoweijnen.nl/blog/2007/10/18/how-rdp-passwords-are-encrypted/) and some help from the comments on that same thread.

This application has been tested to compile in VBExpress 2010, and should work in most all other versions.

Usage:
------
RdpEncrypt password_to_encrypt
